# Example: File-level source sync
#
# This example demonstrates syncing workspace files from multiple sources:
# - Default source directory (workspace.source)
# - File-level source overrides (local paths)
# - GitHub sources (fetched fresh on every sync)

workspace:
  source: ./shared-config           # Default base for files without explicit source
  files:
    # String shorthand - resolved from workspace.source
    - AGENTS.md

    # Object with source relative to workspace.source
    - source: config/settings.json
      dest: settings.json

    # File-level source override (sibling directory)
    # Paths starting with ../ are resolved from workspace root, not workspace.source
    - dest: TEAM-RULES.md
      source: ../team-config/rules.md

    # GitHub source (always fetched fresh)
    # - dest: CONTRIB.md
    #   source: anthropics/claude-plugins-official/CONTRIBUTING.md
