Marketplaces are collections of plugins hosted on GitHub.

## Using Marketplaces

```bash
allagents plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
allagents plugin marketplace list
```

### Branch Selection

To register a marketplace from a non-default branch, use a full GitHub URL with the branch path or the `--branch` flag. A custom `--name` is required for non-default branches:

```bash
# Full GitHub URL with branch
allagents plugin marketplace add https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/feat/v2 --name repo-v2

# Shorthand with --branch flag
allagents plugin marketplace add owner/repo --branch feat/v2 --name repo-v2
```

The bare repo name (e.g., `repo`) is reserved for the default branch. Updates automatically pull the correct branch.

## Creating a Marketplace

```
my-marketplace/
├── plugins/
│   ├── code-review/
│   └── debugging/
└── README.md
```
