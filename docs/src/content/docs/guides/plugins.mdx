Plugins are packages of AI tooling that can be shared across projects and clients.

## Plugin Structure

```
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json
├── skills/          # Cross-client skills
├── commands/        # Claude-specific commands
└── AGENTS.md
```

## Duplicate Skill Handling

When multiple plugins define skills with the same folder name, AllAgents automatically resolves naming conflicts:

| Conflict Type | Resolution | Example |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Same skill folder, different plugins | `{plugin}_{skill}` | `plugin-a_coding-standards` |
| Same skill folder AND plugin name | `{org}_{plugin}_{skill}` (GitHub) | `acme_my-plugin_coding-standards` |
| Same skill folder AND plugin name | `{hash}_{plugin}_{skill}` (local) | `a1b2c3_my-plugin_coding-standards` |

Skills with unique folder names keep their original names unchanged.

**Example:**

```yaml
# workspace.yaml
plugins:
  - ./plugin-a    # has skills/coding-standards/
  - ./plugin-b    # has skills/coding-standards/
  - ./plugin-c    # has skills/testing/
```

After sync:
```
.claude/skills/
├── plugin-a_coding-standards/   # renamed (conflict)
├── plugin-b_coding-standards/   # renamed (conflict)
└── testing/                     # unchanged (unique)
```

## Plugin Spec Format

Plugins use the `plugin@marketplace` format:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Well-known | `code-review@claude-plugins-official` |
| owner/repo | `my-plugin@owner/repo` |
