Plugins are packages of AI tooling that can be shared across projects and clients.

## Plugin Structure

```
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json
├── skills/          # Cross-client skills
├── commands/        # Claude-specific commands
└── AGENTS.md
```

## Plugin Spec Format

Plugins use the `plugin@marketplace` format:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Well-known | `code-review@claude-plugins-official` |
| owner/repo | `my-plugin@owner/repo` |
