A workspace is a directory that contains your AI tooling configuration.

## Creating a Workspace

```bash
allagents workspace init my-workspace
```

## workspace.yaml

```yaml
repositories:
  - path: ../my-project
    owner: myorg
    repo: my-project

plugins:
  - code-review@claude-plugins-official

clients:
  - claude
  - copilot
  - cursor
```

## Syncing Plugins

```bash
allagents workspace sync
```

### Non-Destructive Sync

AllAgents uses **non-destructive sync** to protect your files:

- **First sync**: Overlays plugin files without deleting existing files
- **Subsequent syncs**: Only removes files that AllAgents previously synced

This means your personal commands, skills, or customizations in `.claude/commands/` etc. are never deleted - only files that came from plugins are managed.

AllAgents tracks synced files in `.allagents/sync-state.json`. This file is automatically created and updated on each sync.

### Dry Run

Preview what would happen without making changes:

```bash
allagents workspace sync --dry-run
```
