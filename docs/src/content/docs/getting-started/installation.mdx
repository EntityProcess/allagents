description: How to install AllAgents.
---

AllAgents can be installed globally using npm or run directly with npx.

## Using npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g allagents
```

## Using npx

Run AllAgents without installing:

```bash
npx allagents
```

## Using bun

```bash
bun install -g allagents
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify it's working:

```bash
allagents --version
```

## Updating

AllAgents automatically checks for new versions in the background when you use the interactive TUI. If an update is available, you'll see a notice on startup.

To update manually:

```bash
allagents self update
```

This auto-detects whether you installed with npm or bun and uses the same package manager. You can also force a specific one with `--npm` or `--bun`.
