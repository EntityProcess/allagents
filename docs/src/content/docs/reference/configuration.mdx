## workspace.yaml

The workspace configuration file defines repositories, plugins, workspace file sync, and target clients.

```yaml
# Workspace file sync (optional)
workspace:
  source: ../shared-config              # Default base for relative file paths
  files:
    - AGENTS.md                         # String shorthand: same source and dest
    - source: docs/guide.md             # Object form with explicit source
      dest: GUIDE.md                    # Optional dest (defaults to basename)
    - dest: CUSTOM.md                   # File-level source override
      source: ../other-config/CUSTOM.md
    - dest: AGENTS.md                   # GitHub source
      source: owner/repo/path/AGENTS.md

repositories:
  - path: ../my-project
    owner: myorg
    repo: my-project
    description: Main project repository

plugins:
  - code-review@claude-plugins-official

clients:
  - claude
  - copilot
  - cursor
```

### Workspace File Sync

The `workspace` section enables syncing files from external sources to your workspace root.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `source` | No | Default base directory for resolving relative file paths |
| `files` | Yes | Array of files to sync |

**File entry formats:**

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| String | `AGENTS.md` | Source and dest are the same, resolved from `workspace.source` |
| Object with source | `{source: "path/file.md"}` | Dest defaults to basename |
| Object with dest | `{dest: "file.md", source: "..."}` | Explicit source and dest |

**Source resolution priority:**
1. Explicit `source` on file entry → used directly
2. No `source` → resolved relative to `workspace.source`
3. No `workspace.source` and no explicit `source` → validation error

**GitHub sources:**
- Format: `owner/repo/path/to/file.md`
- Fetched fresh on every sync (always pulls latest)

**Behaviors:**
- Source is the single source of truth; local copies are overwritten
- Deleted local files are restored on next sync
- AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md automatically receive WORKSPACE-RULES injection
