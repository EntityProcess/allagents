## Workspace Commands

```bash
allagents workspace init <path> [--from <source>]
allagents workspace sync [--offline] [--dry-run] [--client <client>] [--scope <scope>]
allagents workspace status
allagents workspace plugin install <plugin@marketplace> [--scope <scope>]
allagents workspace plugin remove <plugin> [--scope <scope>]
```

### workspace init

Initialize a new workspace from a template:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--from <source>` | Copy workspace.yaml from local path or GitHub URL |

**Source formats:**
- Local path: `./path/to/template` or `/absolute/path`
- GitHub URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/branch/path`
- GitHub shorthand: `owner/repo/path` or `owner/repo`

When using a GitHub source, AllAgents fetches `workspace.yaml` from `.allagents/workspace.yaml` or `workspace.yaml` in the target path.

### workspace sync

Syncs plugins to the workspace using non-destructive sync. By default, remote plugins are updated to their latest version.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--offline` | Use cached plugins without fetching latest from remote |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without applying them |
| `-c, --client <client>` | Sync only the specified client (e.g., `opencode`, `claude`) |
| `-s, --scope <scope>` | Sync scope: `project` (default) or `user` |

When `--scope user` is used, sync targets the user-level workspace at `~/.allagents/workspace.yaml` and installs plugins to user directories (`~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, etc.) instead of the project.

**Non-destructive behavior:**
- First sync overlays files without deleting existing user files
- Subsequent syncs only remove files previously synced by AllAgents
- User files (not from plugins) are never deleted

Sync state is tracked in `.allagents/sync-state.json`.

When `vscode` is in the `clients` list, sync also generates a `.code-workspace` file with repository paths resolved to absolute paths. See the [Workspaces guide](/guides/workspaces/#vscode-workspace-generation) for details.

### workspace plugin install / remove

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-s, --scope <scope>` | Installation scope: `project` (default) or `user` |

When `--scope user` is used, the plugin is added to the user-level config at `~/.allagents/workspace.yaml` instead of the project workspace. User-scoped plugins sync to user directories (`~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, etc.) and are available across all projects.

## Self Commands

```bash
allagents self update [--npm] [--bun]
```

### self update

Update AllAgents to the latest published version.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--npm` | Force update using npm |
| `--bun` | Force update using bun |

If neither flag is provided, AllAgents auto-detects the package manager used during installation.

### Automatic Update Notifications

When running the interactive TUI (`allagents` with no arguments), AllAgents checks the npm registry for newer versions in the background. If an update is available, a notice is shown on the next startup:

```
allagents v0.13.4

  ℹ Update available: 0.13.4 → 0.14.0
    Run `allagents self update` to upgrade.
```

The check runs at most once every 24 hours and never blocks startup. Results are cached at `~/.allagents/version-check.json`.

## Plugin Commands

```bash
allagents plugin list [marketplace]
allagents plugin validate <path>
allagents plugin install <plugin> [--scope <scope>]
allagents plugin uninstall <plugin> [--scope <scope>]
allagents plugin marketplace add <source> [--name <name>] [--branch <branch>]
allagents plugin marketplace list
allagents plugin marketplace remove <name>
allagents plugin marketplace update [name]
allagents plugin skills list [--scope <scope>]
allagents plugin skills remove <skill> [--plugin <plugin>] [--scope <scope>]
allagents plugin skills add <skill> [--plugin <plugin>] [--scope <scope>]
```

### plugin skills list

List all skills from installed plugins with their enabled/disabled status.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-s, --scope <scope>` | Scope: `project` (default) or `user` |

### plugin skills remove

Disable a skill, preventing it from being synced to the workspace.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-p, --plugin <plugin>` | Plugin name (required if skill exists in multiple plugins) |
| `-s, --scope <scope>` | Scope: `project` (default) or `user` |

After disabling, the skill is added to `disabledSkills` in workspace.yaml and sync is run to remove it.

### plugin skills add

Re-enable a previously disabled skill.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-p, --plugin <plugin>` | Plugin name (required if skill exists in multiple plugins) |
| `-s, --scope <scope>` | Scope: `project` (default) or `user` |

After enabling, the skill is removed from `disabledSkills` and sync is run to restore it.
