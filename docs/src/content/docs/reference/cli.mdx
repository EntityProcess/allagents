## Workspace Commands

```bash
allagents workspace init <path>
allagents workspace sync [--force] [--dry-run]
allagents workspace status
allagents workspace plugin add <plugin@marketplace>
allagents workspace plugin remove <plugin>
```

### workspace sync

Syncs plugins to the workspace using non-destructive sync:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force`, `-f` | Force re-fetch of remote plugins even if cached |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without applying them |

**Non-destructive behavior:**
- First sync overlays files without deleting existing user files
- Subsequent syncs only remove files previously synced by AllAgents
- User files (not from plugins) are never deleted

Sync state is tracked in `.allagents/sync-state.json`.

## Plugin Commands

```bash
allagents plugin list [marketplace]
allagents plugin validate <path>
allagents plugin marketplace add <source>
allagents plugin marketplace list
allagents plugin marketplace remove <name>
allagents plugin marketplace update [name]
```
