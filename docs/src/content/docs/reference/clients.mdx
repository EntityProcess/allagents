### VSCode

VSCode syncs the same skills, agent file, and commands as Copilot. Additionally, adding `vscode` to `clients` triggers automatic `.code-workspace` file generation and MCP config syncing during `workspace sync`. See the [Workspaces guide](/guides/workspaces/#vscode-workspace-generation) for details.
